# Statmangread: a static manga reader  

This TODO (currently in progress; the TODO is to upload it to GH) project is for a static manga reader (or generic image viewer)  
which can be deployed on providers which do not allow server side deployment, ergo only allow HTML, JS, and CSS, e.g., GH Pages, 
base Wordpress.com (I think). More updates to come.
